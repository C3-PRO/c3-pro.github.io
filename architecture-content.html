<h3>C3-PRO iOS Framework</h3>
<p>
    The C3-PRO iOS framework, written in Swift, adds <a href="http://www.researchkit.org/" target="_blank">ResearchKit</a> functionality to your research app, and then some.
    Built modularly, you need only use components that are useful to you;
    for example the <em>Questionnaire</em> handlers, allowing you to hand <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html" target="_blank">üî• Questionnaire</a> resources to ResearchKit for rendering; no need to hand-code surveys!
</p>
<p>
    An app outfitted with C3-PRO captures consent of participants willing to enroll in a study and handles surveys, interactive tasks and sensory data collection.
    Data is captured as FHIR resources and encrypted on-device using AES and public-key RSA algorithms.
    The private key is only known to the researcher's (in-house) server, making decryption impossible on all public-facing parts.
    The FHIR resources currently in use are:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html" target="_blank">Patient</a>: minimal, HIPAA-compliant de-identified participant information.</li>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/contract.html" target="_blank">Contract</a>: captures consent information.</li>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/observation.html" target="_blank">Observation</a>: patient facts, such as gender and weight, extracted from <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/health/" target="_blank">HealthKit</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html" target="_blank">Questionnaire</a>: resource consumed by the app from the C3-PRO server.</li>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaireresponse.html" target="_blank">QuestionnaireResponse</a>: codifies activity reports and survey answers.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>C3-PRO ‚ÄúReceiver‚Äù Server</h3>
<p>
    Serves as point-of-contact with the app and is the only public-facing part of the toolchain.
    The current release runs in a highly reliable AWS environment to ensure high availability and scalability.
    It's in charge of
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>handling REST calls from the App and temporally store encrypted resources to an SQS</li>
        <li>delivering static content like Questionnaire resources</li>
        <li>managing <a href="http://oauthbible.com/">OAuth 2 two-legged</a> authentications to authorize App requests</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>C3-PRO ‚ÄúConsumer‚Äù</h3>
<p>
    Daemon that runs in-house with highly limited access.
    Consumes from the ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù's SQS queue, decrypts the FHIR resources and sends them into i2b2 using the newly created C3-PRO FHIR i2b2 cell.
    To ensure that all data is recorded properly, encrypted raw data is also stored in-house as BLOB.
</p>

<h3>C3-PRO FHIR i2b2 Cell</h3>
<p>
    An <a href="https://www.i2b2.org/">i2b2</a> <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/">FHIR DSTU-2 </a> compliant cell.
    In this first release the cell accepts PUT and POST REST calls for the resources mentioned above, converting them to i2b2 facts.
