<h3>C3-PRO Research Kit App</h3>
<p>
    Installed on the iPhone, the App is built on the top of Apple's Research Kit. It manages the consent workflow for patients willing to enroll to a study,
    and drive surveys and activity reports performed by the patients. Data is captured as FHIR resources and encrypted in-device using AES and a Public RSA Key generated from an in-house server.
    The used FHIR resources in the first release are:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/questionnaireanswers.html">QuestionnaireAnswers</a>: It codifies activity reports and the answers of the surveys.</li>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/contract.html">Contract</a>: It captures the information regarding the consent form.</li>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/observation.html">Observation</a>: It includes information extracted from <a href="http://www.applehealthkit.com/">Apple's Health Kit</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/patient.html">Patient</a>: It only includes information regarding the US state of the patient.</li>
        <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a>: The app consumes this resource from the C3-PRO-SERVER.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>C3-PRO Server</h3>
<p>
    The current release runs in a highly reliable AWS environment to ensure highly availability and scalability for the App. It's in charge of
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Handeling the REST calls from the App and temporally store the encrypted resources.</li>
        <li>Delivering static content like Questionnaire resources.</li>
        <li>Managing <a href="http://oauthbible.com/">OAuth 2 two-legged</a> protocol to authorize App requests.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>C3-PRO Consumer</h3>
<p>
    It's a daemon that runs in-house under very restrictive access. It consumes from the SQS, decrypts the FHIR resources and sends them into i2b2 using the newly created C3-PRO FHIR I2B2 Cell.
    To ensure that all data is recorded properly, encrypted raw data is also stored in-house as BLOB.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>C3-PRO FHIR I2B2 cell</h3>
<p>
    It's an <a href="https://www.i2b2.org/">i2b2</a> <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/">FHIR DSTU-2 </a> compliant cell. In this first release, it accepts PUT and POST rest calls of the resources mentioned above.
